I have developed a sophisticated automated algorithmic trading system using Python tailored specifically for the Indian stock market which is hosted on the robust AWS cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.

One of its key features is its ability to execute intricate option trading strategies with precision. What sets it apart is its seamless integration with Telegram, enabling real-time notifications and updates, keeping me informed about crucial trading events and outcomes.
